# Getting started with Next.js 15

Next.js 15 introduces several exciting new features and improvements that make building web applications even better. In this post, we'll walk through setting up a new Next.js 15 project and explore some of the key features.

## What's new in Next.js 15?

Next.js 15 includes improvements such as:

- **Improved App Router performance**
- **Partial Prerendering (PPR)**
- **Enhanced Server Components**
- **Turbopack improvements**
- **Better image optimization**

## Setting up a new project

Getting started with Next.js 15 is straightforward. You can create a new project using the following command:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-next-app
```

During the setup, you'll be asked several questions to configure your project:

```
Would you like to use TypeScript? Yes
Would you like to use ESLint? Yes
Would you like to use Tailwind CSS? Yes
Would you like to use the App Router? Yes
Would you like to customize the default import alias? No
```

## Project structure

After initialization, your project will have the following structure:

```
my-next-app/
├── app/
│   ├── favicon.ico
│   ├── globals.css
│   ├── layout.tsx
│   └── page.tsx
├── public/
│   └── ...
├── .eslintrc.json
├── next.config.js
├── package.json
├── postcss.config.js
├── README.md
├── tailwind.config.js
└── tsconfig.json
```

## Using the App Router

Next.js 15 continues to enhance the App Router, which provides a more intuitive way to handle routing in your application.

Here's a simple example of creating routes with the App Router:

```tsx
// app/page.tsx - Home page (/)
export default function Home() {
  return <h1>Home Page</h1>;
}

// app/about/page.tsx - About page (/about)
export default function About() {
  return <h1>About Page</h1>;
}

// app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx - Dynamic blog post pages (/blog/post-1, /blog/post-2, etc.)
export default function BlogPost({ params }: { params: { slug: string } }) {
  return <h1>Blog Post: {params.slug}</h1>;
}
```

## Server Components

Next.js 15 makes Server Components even better. By default, all components in the App Router are Server Components, which means they:

- Run on the server
- Don't include client-side JavaScript
- Can directly access server resources

You can use async/await directly in your components:

```tsx
// This component fetches data on the server
async function BlogPosts() {
  const posts = await fetchBlogPosts(); // Server-side data fetching
  
  return (
    <ul>
      {posts.map((post) => (
        <li key={post.id}>{post.title}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}
```

## Conclusion

Next.js 15 builds upon the solid foundation of previous versions while introducing performance improvements and developer experience enhancements. The App Router and Server Components continue to evolve, making it easier to build fast, scalable applications.

In future posts, we'll explore more advanced features like Partial Prerendering, optimized image handling, and advanced routing patterns.

Happy coding!
