# Using the Callout component

The Callout component allows you to highlight important information in your MDX files. It takes an optional emoji prop to add visual interest.

## Basic usage

Here's how to use a basic Callout:

```mdx
<Callout>
  This is a standard callout without an emoji.
</Callout>
```

Which renders as:

<Callout>
  This is a standard callout without an emoji.
</Callout>

## Adding an emoji

You can add an emoji to make your callout more eye-catching:

```mdx
<Callout emoji="⚠️">
  Warning: This action cannot be undone!
</Callout>
```

Which renders as:

<Callout emoji="⚠️">
  Warning: This action cannot be undone!
</Callout>

## Common emoji use cases

Here are some common use cases for callouts with emojis:

<Callout emoji="💡">
  Tip: You can use keyboard shortcuts to speed up your workflow.
</Callout>

<Callout emoji="ℹ️">
  Note: This feature is available in version 2.0 and above.
</Callout>

<Callout emoji="🚨">
  Alert: Security vulnerability detected!
</Callout>

<Callout emoji="✅">
  Success: Your changes have been saved.
</Callout>

## Styling the Callout

The Callout component uses Tailwind CSS for styling. The default styles include:
- A subtle background color
- Border
- Rounded corners
- Appropriate padding
- Emoji positioned to the left of the content

You can customize the appearance by editing the `Callout` component in `src/components/blog/MDXComponents.tsx`.
