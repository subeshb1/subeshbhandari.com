# Project rules and conventions

## Technology stack

- Next.js (App Router)
- Tailwind CSS v4
- TypeScript

## Important notes

- Tailwind v4 does not use a tailwind.config.js file for configuration
- Project uses next.config.ts instead of next.config.js for type safety

## File structure

- Use the app directory structure following Next.js 13+ conventions
- Keep components in the app/components directory
- Place reusable utilities in the app/lib directory
- Store types in app/types directory

## MDX

- Code highlight is done using shikhi
- Remark, rehype plugins are used for markdown parsing
